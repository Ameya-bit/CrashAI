# CrashAI | Tactical Infrastructure Terminal

A clean, high-performance engineering dashboard for PennDOT, reimagined with an extreme "pill" geometry and the modern, rounded **Comfortaa** design language.

## Design Identity: "The Fluid Pill"
The interface prioritizes accessibility and visual softness while maintaining technical precision.

### Key Visual Characteristics:
- **Typography:** Powered by **Comfortaa**, providing a friendly yet high-tech aesthetic that matches the rounded UI.
- **Targeting Mode:** The top Command Pill now controls the map interaction. Toggle "Targeting" to switch between navigation (panning) and active infrastructure capture (clicking).
- **Ultra-Rounded Geometry:** Corner radii have been pushed to their limits (`rounded-full` and `rounded-[4rem]`) to create a floating, tactile physical-object feel.
- **Interactive Map:** Native map movement (drag/scroll) is now fully enabled, with specific cursors for different operational modes.

## Core Engineering Features
- **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW):** Real-time spatial risk modeling based on 100+ PennDOT crash data points.
- **Optimization Priority:** SHAP-based feature ranking identifies the top 3 infrastructure interventions (LEDs, signals, surfacing).
- **Satellite Hybrid Cartography:** Switch seamlessly between technical vector maps and high-resolution imagery.
